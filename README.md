# Roblox Tower Teleporter ðŸš€

Hey! This is a simple Roblox LocalScript that teleports your character through preset waypoints across different tower maps. Think of it like a smooth teleport tour through all the key spots in your game.

---

## Whatâ€™s in here?

- **Place IDs** mapped to specific towers or maps.
- A list of **Vector3 waypoints** for each place â€” these are the spots youâ€™ll teleport to.
- A teleport loop that zips your character around each waypoint, then sends you back to where you started.
- Adjustable delay (`tpwait`) so you can control the pacing between teleports.

---

## How it works

1. The script checks which place (map) youâ€™re in using `game.PlaceId`.
2. It grabs the list of waypoints for that place.
3. Waits for your character and their HumanoidRootPart (thatâ€™s your avatarâ€™s center).
4. Saves your current position.
5. Teleports your character through each waypoint, waiting a bit if you set `tpwait`.
6. After the last teleport, it returns you to your original spot.

---

## Quick setup

- Put this **LocalScript** in StarterPlayerScripts.
- Adjust the `tpwait` variable to add or remove delay between teleports (default is 0, which means instant).
- Make sure your Place IDs and waypoints match your gameâ€™s tower maps!

---

## Why use this?

- Automatically navigate key spots on your map.
- Cool for demos, testing, or showing off map areas without manual travel.
- Super lightweight and easy to customize.

## Code snippet (because why not)

```lua
local tpwait = 0

local TowerPositions = {
    [95508886069297] = {
        Vector3.new(-22.8, -10.7, 106.7),
        Vector3.new(-186.1, 769.3, 68.3),
        -- more points...
    },
    -- other place IDs and their points
}

local myPlace = game.PlaceId
local waypoints = TowerPositions[myPlace]
if not waypoints then return end

local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local char = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:Wait()
local hrp = char:WaitForChild("HumanoidRootPart")
local originalCF = hrp.CFrame

for _, pos in ipairs(waypoints) do
    hrp.CFrame = CFrame.new(pos)
    wait(tpwait)
end

hrp.CFrame = originalCF
